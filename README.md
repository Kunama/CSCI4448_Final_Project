# Bar Tab Application

## How to Run
This application can be run by just clicking the `index.html` to start the user application and `bartender.html` to start the bartender's application. During development we ran into some issues with a concept called CORS and to get around that we had to install something called `http-server` which essentially made our website a real one that can be accessed through `127.0.0.1:8080` and `127.0.0.1:8080/bartender.html`

When using http-server after it is installed:
1. Navigate to the folder containing the code in a terminal tab
2. Run the command `http-server .`
3. Navigate to the url for which application you want to run

We also uploaded our code to another service which hosts our website to the public. For testing this url can be used too:

`https://bartab.netlify.app`

`https://bartab.netlify.app/bartender.html`

Recommended testing is to have both sites open side by side so you can see the immediate addition of new items to the tab.
